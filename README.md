A phone-focused theme for Obsidian

[Screenshots](#screenshots) | 
[Features](#features) | [What's new](#changelog) | [Fonts](#fonts) | [Buy me a coffe](#contribution)


[Lagom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom) tries to focus on just the right amount of changes needed to make it look aesthetically more conventional and modern. It's not about reinventing the wheel or offering a unique or special theme. I simply think Obsidian is a diamond in the rough that needs to be polished to shine on its own.✨ 

**The theme attempts to follow the following principles:**

1. Avoid as much as possible an extreme minimalism that prevents me from recognizing what is and what is not in the UI.
  

2. Make subtle changes that are noticeable and make a difference both aesthetically and functionally but do not prove to be a distraction when using Obsidian.
   
3. Symmetry and visual consistency.
   
4. Focused exclusively for use on phones or tablets.
  
5. Do not follow a specific color palette or typeface (so you can use it with the one you prefer!) 

6. [Complementary and modular](Comparison)

*Work in progress...*

# Features

- The file panel occupies 100% of the screen to take advantage of the available space (optional pop-up style)

- Files show their full name on multiple lines. No more unfinished titles or ellipses!

- Nested folders with a subtle open-folder indicator

- Editor dims blocks of text that is not in focus (and slightly increases the font size of text in focus) 

- Separator inspired by the book *A Psalm for the Wild-Built*

- Code blocks more similar in appearance to a MacOS terminal (colorful for dark mode and monochromatic for light mode)

# Note

It is recommended to use *Commander*, *Iconize*, *custom file explorer sorting* and *File explorer note count* with this theme for a complete experience.

*If you want to use Lagom alongside another theme (Gruvebox, Rosé Pine, Borealis, etc.), you can simply move the theme.css file into your snippets folder and activate it.*

# Roadmap

- Clean and improve the css code 
- Adapt it for the rest of the platforms 
- Fix some aesthetic details
- [x] ~~Add options for Style Settings~~
