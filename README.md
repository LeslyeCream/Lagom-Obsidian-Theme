A phone-focused theme for Obsidian

[Lagom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom) tries to focus on just the right amount of changes needed to make it look aesthetically more conventional and modern. It's not about reinventing the wheel or offering a unique or special theme. I just think it's a diamond in the rough that needs to be polished to shine on its own. âœ¨ 

*This theme is a way for me to learn about the way (design and css) and constantly improve while sharing my results* â˜º 

**The theme attempts to follow the following principles:**

1. Avoid as much as possible an extreme minimalism that prevents me from recognizing what is and what is not in the UI.
  

2. Make subtle changes that are noticeable and make a difference both aesthetically and functionally but do not prove to be a distraction when using Obsidian.
   
3. Symmetry and visual consistency.
   
4. Focused exclusively for use on phones or tablets.
  
5. Do not follow a specific color palette or typeface.

*The fonts I use in the screenshots:* 

**Main font:** Akrobat semibold or Pragati regular 

**Headers:** Play fair display 

**Mono:** I love the [Nothing](https://us.nothing.tech/) font but I'm not really sure if it is possible for personal use. So... nothing for now. ðŸ‘€ 

**Code:** Jetbrains

**Quotes:** Caecelia 

*I'm still looking for similar alternatives to these fonts that harmonize with each other.*

# Features

- The file panel occupies 100% of the screen to take advantage of the available space.

- Editor dims blocks of text that is not in focus (and slightly increases the font size of text in focus) 

- Separator inspired by the book *A Psalm for the Wild-Built*

- Code blocks more similar in appearance to a MacOS terminal (colorful for dark mode and monochromatic for light mode)
