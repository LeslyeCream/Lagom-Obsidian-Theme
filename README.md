# Lagom-Obsidian-Theme
A phone-focused theme for Obsidian

[Lagom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom) tries to focus on just the right amount of changes needed to make it look aesthetically more conventional and modern. It's not about reinventing the wheel or offering a unique or special theme. I just think it's a diamond in the rough that needs to be polished to shine on its own. ✨ 

*This theme is a way for me to learn about the way (design and css) and constantly improve while sharing my results* ☺ 

**The theme attempts to follow the following principles:**

1. Avoid as much as possible an extreme minimalism that prevents me from recognizing what is and what is not in the UI.
  

2. Make subtle changes that are noticeable and make a difference both aesthetically and functionally but do not prove to be a distraction when using Obsidian.
   
3. Symmetry and visual consistency.
   
4. Focused exclusively for use on phones or tablets.
  
5. Do not follow a specific color palette or typeface.
